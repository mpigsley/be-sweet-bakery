                Baking sweet treats has been a lifelong passion. As a young
                girl, my parents purchased an easy bake oven for me and almost
                immediately, my passion was born! From cakes to cookies,
                cupcakes to pies, I wanted to make it all! I always took great
                joy in baking for friends and family and was encouraged to open
                my own business. While achieving my business degree from
                University of Nebraska - Omaha, I finally decided to make my
                dreams a reality in October 2015! I am now the full time
                owner/designer for Be Sweet Bakery.
